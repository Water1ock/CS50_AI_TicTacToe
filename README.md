# CS50_AI_TicTacToe
This project of mine consisted of implementing a simple tic tac toe game. The computer has been programmed to ouput the best move against the player using the minimax algorithm.
The GUI of the game was implemented using the pygame library. The file "runner.py" contains code implementing the GUI and "tictactoe.py" consists of functions implementing the
minimax algorithm, along with functions which define the state of the board and look at next possible moves for the AI.
